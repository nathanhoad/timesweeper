# Timesweeper

A frantic two player minesweeper style game.

I built this game because I came across [GOTM.io](https://gotm.io) and was curious about their networking addon. This was a small but practical test to find out how to use it.

The code might be a bit messy but it served it's purpose and I'm a fan of [publishing prototypes](https://nathanhoad.net/2018-02-publish-your-prototypes/).

You can [play Timesweeper on Itch](https://nathanhoad.itch.io/timesweeper).
